# ShengUfs

ShengUfs provides the sheng UFS storage path for SM8550. It owns the host
controller, SMMU mappings, command queues, and root reads. Its board integration
includes clock resources and the persistent Data and log regions.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | [UniXNU/ShengUfs](https://github.com/UniXNU/ShengUfs) |
| Hardware | SM8550 UFS host, PHY, clocks and SMMU resources |
| Board dependencies | sheng power policy and storage layout |
| Verified device | sheng native UFS root |
| Runtime class | `NativeUfs` |

The component catalog supplies its kernel archive recipe. The selected device
profile enables `CONFIG_XNU_NATIVE_UFS` and supplies the board inputs.

```sh
./unixnu build kernel -D ../UniXNU-sheng
```

## Porting and records

The sheng device repository supplies ShengUfs as a submodule. Follow the
[UFS porting guide](/porting/ufs) and maintain controller, clock, PHY, SMMU,
DMA, partition and completion details in the [storage record](/devices/sheng#storage).
