# Device template

This template selects shared SM8550 and iPadOS 17.7.11 support. Complete the
hardware inputs before building.

1. Copy this directory to `UniXNU-<device>` and read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Set the board name, description, firmware paths, and complete component selection. Add the shared `UniXNURamDiskDxe` and filesystem dependencies to the firmware DSC and FDF using the [firmware integration guide](https://unixnu.com/porting/uefi-firmware#required-integration).
3. Pin a reviewed SoC commit in `feeds.toml`.
4. Fill the DTS model, compatible values, memory map, CPU selection, and peripherals.
5. List firmware sources and hashes in `proprietary-files.txt`.
6. Set partition geometry and payload inputs from the device's records.
7. Complete each area in `porting.toml`, including ownership paths, findings and completion criteria.
8. Enable the template CI workflow and require its `Porting record` check on the official device branch.
9. Set `example = false`, select the defconfig, fetch, and inspect `status --json`.

The zero memory range and `REQUIRED_` values identify inputs to complete.
`patches/xnu/series` lists board patches in application order. `package/` contains
board packaging. Shared resources come from the selected SoC and component sources.

`porting.toml` is the shared maintainer and agent record. The site renders it
from the device commit pinned in UniXNU's `devices.toml`. Publish that pin with
the English and Chinese device pages. Put board driver submodules in this
device repository. See the [record guide](https://unixnu.com/porting/records)
and [UFS guide](https://unixnu.com/porting/ufs).

```sh
python3 scripts/porting-record.py check --device ../UniXNU-example
```

Run this command from UniXNU.

## Local builds and boot diagnosis

Copy `unixnu.example.toml` to `unixnu.local.toml` in the main checkout and fill
in device inputs using the [configuration reference](https://unixnu.com/reference/configuration#local-build-inputs).
Read [boot arguments](https://unixnu.com/xnu/boot-arguments#apply-arguments)
before changing the command line. Rebuild the payload and boot image after
argument changes. Use the [green-bar diagnosis](https://unixnu.com/guide/debugging#green-bar)
for stalls at loader handoff. Record the last confirmed stage and relevant logs.
